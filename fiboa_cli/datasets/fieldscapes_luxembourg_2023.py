DESCRIPTION = """Luxembourg's Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) is managed by The Administration of Technical Agricultural Services (ASTA). The data is made available to the public on The Luxembourg Data Platform based on the Creative Commons 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication.The plot-based parcel reference system (FLIK) in Luxembourg was digitally recorded for the first time in 2005 based on aerial photos. Since then, the system has been continuously revised via the latest aerial images.Onsite measurements using GPS are carried out for unclear boundaries cases as well an assessment of the parcel's eligibility for payment.The FLIK parcels are categorized into eligible agricultural parcels, eligible vineyard parcels, ineligible parcels, and non-payable objects. The data has been uploaded to geoDB and is available from 2016 to 2021 annually with updates expected annually."""

    Converts the field boundary datasets to fiboa.

    For reference, this is the order in which the conversion steps are applied:
    0. Read GeoDataFrame from file(s) and run the FILE_MIGRATION function if provided
    1. Run global migration (if provided through MIGRATION)
    2. Run filters to remove rows that shall not be in the final data
       (if provided through COLUMN_FILTERS)
    3. Add columns with constant values
    4. Run column migrations (if provided through COLUMN_MIGRATIONS)
    5. Duplicate columns (if an array is provided as the value in COLUMNS)
    6. Rename columns (as provided in COLUMNS)
    7. Remove columns (if column is not present as value in COLUMNS)
    8. Create the collection
    9. Change data types of the columns based on the provided schemas
    (fiboa spec, extensions, and MISSING_SCHEMAS)
    10. Write the data to the Parquet file

    Parameters:
    output_file (str): Path where the Parquet file shall be stored.
    cache (str): Path to a cached folder for the data. Default: None.
                      Can be used to avoid repetitive downloads from the original data source.
    source_coop_url (str): URL to the (future) Source Cooperative repository. Default: None
    collection (bool): Additionally, store the collection separate from Parquet file. Default: False
    compression (str): Compression method for the Parquet file. Default: zstd
    kwargs: Additional keyword arguments for GeoPanda's read_file() or read_parquet() function.
